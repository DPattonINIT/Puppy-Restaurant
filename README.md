**Project Name**: Puppy Resturant
**Description**: Take the following mockup and make a fully functioning and responsive website with the group members assigned to you. Your project must be using GitHub and each person needs to have their own branch. Make sure to include the GitHub link for your project. Towards the end, submit a one page peer review for each of your group members and a one page self reflection on how you think you did. Each member needs to submit the entire project. 

**Peer**: Gianpaolo Reinares
**Review**:
> Site looks great and matches the mockup; responiveness functions; in 'About', AboutMain.jpg (alt - "About Main") does not scale with the text box; 'Menu', 'Catering' and 'Photo' all look great (I love the addition of the 'zoom' feature); besides a little bit of minor tweaks, great job.
